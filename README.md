## Autojack

Built using React.js, Autojack is a blackjack game that can be played manually or automatically. I used this project to learn React with functional components, React Hooks, and how to partition code for readability. Autojack also makes use of an animation library: Framer Motion. Autojack also has multiple themes to choose from.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
